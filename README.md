# IMDB: The Rating Game
Hello! and welcome to my first personal project as an aspiring programmer. 
For my first personal project for General Assembly I've made a trivia game with a bit of a twist. 
It's a trivia game where you get a random movie as your question along with several "ratings" to choose from. Select the one you think is correct to score points.
