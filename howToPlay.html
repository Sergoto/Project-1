            Welcome to the IMDB Rating Trivia game, where you'll get a random
            movie to rate as your question along with 4 different movie ratings to
            choose from (Ratings from 1.0 to 10.0), pick the one you think is the IMDB rating and see if
            you're right, if you were close, or if you were way off!

            Time to put your movie taste to the test against the rest of the
            internet!
